# Machine Learning Projects: NBA Game Prediction & ICPC Competitions

This repository contains two machine learning projects: one for predicting NBA game outcomes and the other for forecasting winners of ICPC coding competitions. Both projects showcase my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling.

## Projects Overview

### 1. NBA Game Prediction
This project predicts the outcome of NBA games, including the winning team and score differential, based on historical data. Key factors such as team statistics, player availability, and injuries are incorporated to enhance prediction accuracy.

- **Techniques Used**: Random Forest, Feature Scaling, Team Stats Analysis (FG%, OREB, DREB, TOV, STL, BLK, W%).
- **Main Tools**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn.
- **Data Source**: Custom dataset containing team performance metrics and game outcomes.

### 2. ICPC Coding Competitions Predictor
In this project, I developed a model to predict the winners of ICPC coding competitions using historical competition data and performance metrics.

- **Techniques Used**: Data preprocessing, visualization, machine learning models.
- **Main Tools**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- **Data Source**: ICPC historical data (competition results and team performance).

## Files in This Repository
- **nba_prediction_model.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for the NBA game prediction model.
- **icpc_competitions_predictor.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for the ICPC competitions predictor.
- **data/**: Directory containing datasets for both projects.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the repository.

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git

2. Install the required Python packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Open the Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files) to explore the models and learn more about the techniques used.

## Future Plans
- Experiment with additional machine learning algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, Neural Networks).
- Integrate real-time data for more accurate predictions in both projects.
- Improve feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance.
